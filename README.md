- 👋 Hi, I’m @lokesh-kurre
- 👀 I’m interested in competetive programming, and partly web developement, mostly in back-end logic.
-     I'm good at front-end developement, except for the creativity part, if task is given to design a webSite with given design, I'm pretty much confident in completing it.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning data-structure & nodejs.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on web-developement, mainly for experience gaining, so I can have a rough view of how things work. 
      Which will help me doing things of my interest or contribute to open sources.
